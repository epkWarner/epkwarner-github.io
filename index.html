        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>“Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.” Gone With the Wind, 1939 “I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse.” The Godfather, 1972 Fun fact: This line makes it into each Godfather film in some way or another. “You don't understand! I coulda had class. I coulda been a contender. I could've been somebody, instead of a bum, which is what I am.” On the Waterfront, 1954 “Toto, I've got a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.” The Wizard of Oz, 1939 Fun fact: As one of the most famous movie quotes in film history, this line has been parodied by many different movies and television shows. “Here's looking at you, kid.” Casablanca, 1942 “Go ahead, make my day.” Sudden Impact, 1983 “All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up.” Sunset Blvd., 1950 Han Solo saying may the force be with you “May the Force be with you.” Star Wars, 1977 “Fasten your seatbelts. It's going to be a bumpy night.” All About Eve, 1950 “You talking to me?” Taxi Driver, 1976 Fun fact: Robert DeNiro improvised this line.

James Bond.” Dr. No, 1962 James Bond quote, Bond, James Bond. “There's no place like home.” The Wizard of Oz, 1939 “I am big! It's the pictures that got small.” Sunset Blvd., 1950 “Show me the money!” Jerry Maguire, 1996 “Why don't you come up sometime and see me?” She Done Him Wrong, 1933 “I'm walking here! I'm walking here!” Midnight Cowboy, 1969 Dustin Hoffman midnight cowboyFun fact: This scene was improvised. Midnight Cowboy filmed in New York City so the taxi in the shot is an actual New York taxi.

This is a cinematic clue that Bruce Willis's character is dead.Stella, Hey Stella scene Streetcar “Stella! Hey, Stella!” A Streetcar Named Desire, 1951 “Oh, Jerry, don't let's ask for the moon. We have the stars.” Now, Voyager, 1942 “Shane. Shane. Come back!” Shane, 1953 “Well, nobody's perfect.” Some Like It Hot, 1959 “It's alive! It's alive!” Frankenstein, 1931 Fun fact: The original line was "It's alive! It's alive! In the name of God!

Aren't you?” The Graduate, 1967 “Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room!"

Attica!” Dog Day Afternoon, 1975 “Sawyer, you're going out a youngster, but you've got to come back a star!” 42nd Street, 1933 “Listen to me, mister. You're my knight in shining armor.
